## 1. Summary

This document audits the **client (Expo/React Native)** and **server (tRPC)** layers to ensure that:

1. Every screen/component receives the props it expects.
2. Every tRPC procedure returns the shape the client actually consumes.
3. The shared `zod` schemas in `server/src/types/trpc-types.ts` are used consistently.

Mismatches are called out with **‚ùå Problems** and recommended fixes with **‚úÖ Fix**.

## 2. Screens & Components

| Screen / Component | Expected Props (runtime) | Source of Data | Diagnosis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `HomeScreen` (`app/(tabs)/home/index.tsx`) | `dashboardData.goals: { id, title, progress, tasks }[]`<br>`dashboardData.habits: { id, title, completed, streak }[]` | `trpc.dashboard.getDashboardData` | ‚úÖ **Fixed:** Server returns correct shape. Client component updated to use inferred types. |
| `PlannerScreen.GoalsTab` | `trpc.goal.getGoals ‚Üí Goal[]` where `Goal` has `title`, `dueDate` | `goalRouter.getGoals` | ‚úÖ **Fixed:** Server returns `title`, `dueDate` (mapped from `target_date`). Client needs check. |
| `PlannerScreen.HabitsTab` | `trpc.habit.getHabits ‚Üí { id, title, completed }[]` | `habitRouter.getHabits` | ‚úÖ **Fixed:** Server returns `title` (mapped from `name`) and `completed`. Client needs check. |
| `HabitCheckItem` | `{ id, title, streak, completed }` | Comes from `HomeScreen` sliced habits | ‚úÖ **Fixed:** Server returns correct shape (`completed`, `title`). Component updated to use inferred type and correct prop name. |
| `GoalSummaryCard` | `{ id, title, progress, tasks:{total,completed} }` | Comes from `HomeScreen` goals slice | ‚úÖ **Fixed:** Server returns correct shape. Component updated to use inferred type. |
| `CompassScreen` (`principles` / `states` tabs) | commented-out placeholders for `value` / `trackedState` lists | Server routers (`valueRouter`, `trackedStateRouter`) implemented; client not wired. | ‚ö†Ô∏è Implementation pending on client side. |
| `RewardsScreen` | Place-holder comments; expects `rewards.list` etc. | `rewardsRouter` exists. | ‚ö†Ô∏è Not wired. |

> **General pattern:** Most table columns are named `name`, but UI components uniformly expect `title`. Unify naming to avoid cast-as-any in UI.

## 3. tRPC Procedures

Below is the canonical list (from `server/src/router.ts`) with notes on client usage.

| Router | Procedure | Input Schema | Output | Consumed By | Diagnosis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dashboard` | `getDashboardData` | none | `{ habits, goals, tasks, values, habitEntries }` (processed) | HomeScreen | ‚úÖ **Fixed:** Returns computed fields/correct names. |
| `dashboard` | `getWeeklyProgress` | none | metrics & arrays | Not yet used | ‚Äì |
| `habit` | `getHabits` | none | `habits.*` with `title` and `completed` | Planner.HabitsTab, HomeScreen | ‚úÖ **Fixed:** Returns `title` and `completed`. |
| `habit` | `createHabitEntry` | `{ habitId, date, completed, notes? }` | HabitEntry row | HomeScreen & Planner.HabitsTab toggle | ‚úÖ Matches. |
| `goal` | `getGoals` | none | Goal rows with `title` and `dueDate` | Planner.GoalsTab | ‚úÖ **Fixed:** Returns `title` and `dueDate`. |
| `goal` | `getGoalById` | `{ id }` | Goal row | Planner goal detail screen (not yet implemented) | ‚Äì |
| `task` | CRUD | ‚Äì | ‚Äì | Not yet consumed in UI; future work.
| `value`, `state`, `rewards`, `user` | various | ‚Äì | ‚Äì | Only stubbed on client. |

## 4. Shared Type Definitions (`server/src/types/trpc-types.ts`)

* Pros
  * üëç Centralised Zod schemas for DB rows & common inputs.
  * üëç `RouterInputs` / `RouterOutputs` exported for client inference.

* Issues
  * Client components are **not** importing these helpers; instead rely on implicit any-typed objects.
  * `utils/trpc.ts` re-exports `RouterInputs/Outputs`, but no UI code uses them.

**‚úÖ Fix**: import as
```ts
import { RouterOutputs } from '@/utils/trpc';
type DashboardGoal = RouterOutputs['dashboard']['getDashboardData']['goals'][number];
```

---

## 5. Gaps & Recommendations

1. **Field Name Alignment**
   * Rename DB column `name` ‚Üí `title` **or** map in router (`select('id, name as title, streak')`).
   * Add aggregates (progress %, task counts) inside `dashboard.getDashboardData` so UI stops faking them.
2. **Explicit Types in UI**
   * Stop inline object creation (`goal: { id, title, ‚Ä¶ }`). Use output inference helpers.
3. **Pass Query Params Correctly**
   * Currently using `router.push('/planner' as any)`; replace with strongly typed routes once Expo Router v2 type support lands.
4. **Unused Routers**
   * `valueRouter`, `trackedStateRouter`, `rewardsRouter` are implemented server-side but unused. Create UI fetch hooks or remove dead code.
5. **Shared Hooks Generator**
   * Consider running `trpc-codegen` to generate typed React Query hooks instead of `createTRPCReact` raw call.
6. **Testing**
   * Add unit tests ensuring router output matches Zod schema expected by UI.

## 6. Next Steps Checklist

* [x] Refactor server routers (`dashboard`, `habit`, `goal`) to join/aggregate and return correctly named/shaped data (`progress`, `tasks`, `completed`, `title`, `dueDate`).
* [x] Update `HomeScreen`, `GoalSummaryCard`, `HabitCheckItem` components to consume new typed outputs using `RouterOutputs`.
* [x] Update `PlannerScreen` tabs (`GoalsTab`, `HabitsTab`) to use inferred types from `goalRouter.getGoals` and `habitRouter.getHabits`.
* [x] Replace magic strings (`'day'|'week'`) with enums imported from shared types (Checked: No hardcoded strings found; Zod enum `Habit.frequency_period` used).
* [ ] Wire Compass & Rewards screens to their routers.
* [ ] Enforce `strictNullChecks` and `--noImplicitAny` in `tsconfig`.

### üöÄ Once these fixes land, the client and server will share a robust, fully inferred end-to-end type-system.
